\title{Draw a random sample}
\usage{
draw_rs(declaration = NULL, N = NULL, strata = NULL, clusters = NULL,
  n = NULL, prob = NULL, strata_n = NULL, strata_prob = NULL,
  simple = FALSE, check_inputs = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{declaration}{A random sampling declaration, created by \code{\link{declare_rs}}.}

\item{N}{The number of units. N must be a positive integer. (required)}

\item{strata}{A vector of length N that indicates which stratum each unit belongs to.}

\item{clusters}{A vector of length N that indicates which cluster each unit belongs to.}

\item{n}{Use for a design in which n units (or clusters) are sampled. In a stratified design, exactly n units in each stratum will be sampled. (optional)}

\item{prob}{Use for a design in which either floor(N*prob) or ceiling(N*prob) units (or clusters) are sampled. The probability of being sampled is exactly prob because with probability 1-prob, floor(N*prob) units (or clusters) will be sampled and with probability prob, ceiling(N*prob) units (or clusters) will be sampled. prob must be a real number between 0 and 1 inclusive. (optional)}

\item{strata_n}{Use for a design in which strata_n describes the number of units to sample within each stratum.}

\item{strata_prob}{Use for a design in which strata_prob describes the probability of being sampled within each stratum. Differs from prob in that the probability of being sampled can vary across strata.}

\item{simple}{logical, defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, simple random sampling is used. When \code{simple = TRUE}, please do not specify n or strata_n. When \code{simple = TRUE}, \code{prob} may vary by unit.}

\item{check_inputs}{logical. Defaults to TRUE.}

\description{
You can either give draw_rs() an declaration, as created by \code{\link{declare_rs}} or you can specify the other arguments to describe a random sampling procedure.

\examples{
declaration <- declare_rs(N = 100, n = 30)
S <- draw_rs(declaration = declaration)
table(S)

# equivalent to
S <- draw_rs(N = 100, n = 30)
table(S)
