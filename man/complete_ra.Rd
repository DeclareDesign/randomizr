\usage{
complete_ra(N, m = NULL, num_arms = NULL, m_each = NULL,
  prob_each = NULL, condition_names = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{the total number of units in the experimental sample.}

\item{m}{if specified, a two-group design is assumed.  m is the total number of units to be assigned to treatment. Should only be specified for a two group design in which exactly m of N units to treatment. If not specified, half of the sample (N/2) will be assigned to treatment. Is null by default.}

\item{num_arms}{the total number of treatment arms. If unspecified, will be determined from the length of m_each or condition_names.}

\item{m_each}{a numeric vector giving the size of each treatment group. Must sum to N. If unspecified, equally sized (rounded) groups will be assumed.}

\item{prob_each}{a numeric giving the probability of assignment to each treatment arm. Must sum to 1.  Please note that due to rounding, these probabilities are approximate. For finer control, please use m_each.}

\item{condition_names}{a character vector giving the names of the treatment groups.  If unspecified, the treatment groups will be names T1, T2, T3, etc.}
}
\description{
This function conducts complete random assignment, a procedure in which a pre-specified number of units is assigned to each treatment condition.  This function can accomodate any number of treatment arms.

# Two Group Designs
