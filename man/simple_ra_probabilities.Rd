\usage{
simple_ra_probabilities(N, prob = NULL, prob_each = NULL, num_arms = NULL,
  conditions = NULL, check_inputs = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{The number of units. N must be a positive integer. (required)}

\item{prob}{Use for a two-arm design. prob is the probability of assignment to treatment and must be a real number between 0 and 1 inclusive and must be length 1 or N. (optional)}

\item{prob_each}{Use for a multi-arm design in which the values of prob_each determine the probabilities of assignment to each treatment condition. prob_each must be a numeric vector giving the probability of assignment to each condition. All entries must be nonnegative real numbers between 0 and 1 inclusive and the total must sum to 1. It may be a conditions-length vector or a N-by-conditions matrix.  (optional)}

\item{num_arms}{The number of treatment arms. If unspecified, num_arms will be determined from the other arguments. (optional)}

\item{conditions}{A character vector giving the names of the treatment groups. If unspecified, the treatment groups will be named 0 (for control) and 1 (for treatment) in a two-arm trial and T1, T2, T3, in a multi-arm trial. An exception is a two-group design in which num_arms is set to 2, in which case the condition names are T1 and T2, as in a multi-arm trial with two arms. (optional)}

\item{check_inputs}{logical. Defaults to TRUE.}
}
