\usage{
strata_and_cluster_rs_probabilities(strata = NULL, clusters = NULL,
  prob = NULL, n = NULL, strata_n = NULL, strata_prob = NULL,
  check_inputs = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{strata}{A vector of length N that indicates which stratum each unit belongs to.}

\item{clusters}{A vector of length N that indicates which cluster each unit belongs to.}

\item{prob}{Use for a design in which either floor(N_clusters_stratum*prob) or ceiling(N_clusters_stratum*prob) clusters are sampled within each stratum. The probability of being sampled is exactly prob because with probability 1-prob, floor(N_clusters_stratum*prob) clusters will be sampled and with probability prob, ceiling(N_clusters_stratum*prob) clusters will be sampled. prob must be a real number between 0 and 1 inclusive. (optional)}

\item{n}{Use for a design in which the scalar n describes the fixed number of units to sample in each stratum. This number does not vary across strata.}

\item{strata_n}{Use for a design in which strata_n describes the number of units to sample within each stratum.}

\item{strata_prob}{Use for a design in which strata_prob describes the probability of being sampled within each stratum. Differs from prob in that the probability of being sampled can vary across strata.}

\item{check_inputs}{logical. Defaults to TRUE.}
}
\value{
A vector length N indicating the probability of being sampled.
