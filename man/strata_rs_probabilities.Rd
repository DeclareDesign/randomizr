\usage{
strata_rs_probabilities(strata = NULL, prob = NULL, n = NULL,
  strata_n = NULL, strata_prob = NULL, check_inputs = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{strata}{A vector of length N that indicates which stratum each unit belongs to. Can be a character, factor, or numeric vector. (required)}

\item{prob}{Use for a design in which either floor(N_stratum*prob) or ceiling(N_stratum*prob) units are sampled within each stratum. The probability of  being sampled is exactly prob because with probability 1-prob, floor(N_stratum*prob) units will be sampled and with probability prob, ceiling(N_stratum*prob) units will be sampled. prob must be a real number between 0 and 1 inclusive. (optional)}

\item{n}{Use for a design in which the scalar n describes the fixed number of units to sample in each stratum. This number does not vary across strata.}

\item{strata_n}{Use for a design in which the numeric vector strata_n describes the number of units to sample within each stratum.}

\item{strata_prob}{Use for a design in which strata_prob describes the probability of being sampled within each stratum. Differs from prob in that the probability of being sampled can vary across strata.}

\item{check_inputs}{logical. Defaults to TRUE.}
}
\value{
A vector length N indicating the probability of being sampled.
