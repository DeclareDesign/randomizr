\title{Obtain inclusion probabilities}
\usage{
obtain_inclusion_probabilities(declaration = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{declaration}{A random sampling declaration, created by \code{\link{declare_rs}}.}
}
\description{
You can either give obtain_inclusion_probabilities() an declaration, as created by \code{\link{declare_rs}} or you can specify the other arguments to describe a random sampling procedure.\cr \cr
This function is especially useful when units have different inclusion probabilities and the analyst plans to use inverse-probability weights.

\examples{

# Draw a stratified random sample
strata <- rep(c("A", "B","C"), times=c(50, 100, 200))

declaration <- declare_rs(strata = strata)

observed_probabilities <-
   obtain_inclusion_probabilities(declaration = declaration)

table(strata, observed_probabilities)


# Sometimes it is convenient to skip the declaration step
observed_probabilities <-
   obtain_inclusion_probabilities(strata = strata)

table(strata, observed_probabilities)

}
