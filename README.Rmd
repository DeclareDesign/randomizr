randomizr is designed to make conducting field, lab, survey, or online experiments easier by automating the random assignment process.  

Installation from github is easy.  In r:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("acoppock/randomizr")
```

There are four functions in randomizr: simple_ra(), complete_ra(), block_ra(), and cluster_ra(), corresponding to common experimental designs. 

complete_ra() is the workhorse function that will be most appropriate for a large number of experimental situations: it assigns m of N units to treatment:

```{r}
library(randomizr)
Z <- complete_ra(N=100, m=50)
table(Z)
```

Happy randomizing!
